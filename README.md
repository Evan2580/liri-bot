# liri-bot

This is a webcrawler that uses 3 different API's bandsintown, spotify and omdb.  You run the program with node liri.js then it enters into a command prompt/drop down menu to ask you some questions USE THE ARROW KEYS UP AND DOWN to select a band, spotify song search or a movie. After searching it will ask you another relevant question then so you can enter with the keyboard your search selection.  Then it will pull down some API data that I selected to be relevant.
